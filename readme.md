Restart - A companion for the grey days in life

A lot of people suffer from depression and anxiety, and we are trying to change that by creating a platform where the user can interact with others and set self-goals for themselves, and get a sense of achievement upon completion. The LoFi music playiung in the background helps in reducing the stress in the process. The user can also interact with other people sharing their goals/thoughts via Aid tab and have a virtual therapy session anonymously, the user can also choose to interact with therapist for further assistance if required.
